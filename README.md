# Personal-Projects
See the attached files for a look at a few projects I have worked on in my spare time.

1. Cape Cod Scheduling project
- This project was working with the Cape Cod League to create an optimal schedule for their 2023 playing season
- They debuted a new scheduling format for the 2023 season
- They tried doing it by hand but quickly realized it was too complex
- Developed a comprehensive model to ensure a fair and balanced schedule that met all requirements

2. Arbitration Linear Regression Model (Position Players)
- This project was a personal project where I used predictive modeling to predict the salaries of arbitration eligible players
- I used data from numerous seasons to build a highly effective model that compares well to MLBTR's
