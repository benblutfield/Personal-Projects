See the attached files for a look at a few projects I have worked on in my spare time.

1. Cape Cod Scheduling project
- This project was working with the Cape Cod League to create an optimal schedule for their 2023 playing season
- They debuted a new scheduling format for the 2023 season
- They tried doing it by hand but quickly realized it was too complex
- Developed a comprehensive model to ensure a fair and balanced schedule that met all requirements.
